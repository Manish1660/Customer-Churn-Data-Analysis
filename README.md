# Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis

Key aspects of the project:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data, and encoded categorical features to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized statistical methods and visualization techniques, such as histograms, correlation matrices, and box plots, to explore the relationships between different customer attributes and churn.

Modeling: Applied machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict customer churn, evaluating models based on accuracy, precision.

Insights: Derived critical factors impacting churn, such as customer demographics, tenure, and service usage, helping businesses understand the drivers behind customer loss.
